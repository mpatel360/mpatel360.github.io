// When a route has children, and you're at the parent route's path, the <Outlet> had nothing to render because no children match. You can think of index routes as the default child route to fill in that space.

// The route name _index is special. It tells Remix to match and render this route when the user is at the parent route's exact path, so there are no other child routes to render in the <Outlet />.
